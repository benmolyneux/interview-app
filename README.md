# Setup

- Install dependancies
- Run application
- Open application in the browser

# Tasks (30 minutes)

- Add the description to the TodoItem. It should be crossed out when the item is marked as completed (Get off mark, ability to read existing code and typescript errors)

- When the 'Hide Completed' checkbox is checked, all completed tasks should not be visible (General react patterns and js filtering)

- The items should be sorted by the selected key in the sort select box, date in descending order, title in ascending order (Same again but js sorting)

- Get delete button working with application (API REST understanding and bit of above)

- Create a page for an individual TODO

# Questions (15 minutes)

- Talk me through how you would go about any uncompleted tasks?

- If you had more time, what would you change about the application and what you do differently?

- How would you optimise for first page load?

- Talk me through what your testing strategy would be for the application?
